# writeups

A repository containing my writeups of algorithms and theoretical ideas from different projects.

The papers included here are:

1. **A Geometric Construction for the Evaluation of Mean Curvature** *June 2016* Grinfeld at al. have published a new formula for evaluating the mean curvature of continuous surfaces using the tools of tensor calculus. I extend this result by finding how it generalizes to triangulated surfaces, so that the mean curvature at the vertices of meshes can be quickly computed.
2. **Accurately and Efficiently Identifying Centers of Circular Symmetry in Images** *July 2015* An algorithm for identifying circles of varying scale in images based on image gradients, which I used to identify circular beads in microscope images.
3. **Evaluating Optimality of Legged Robot Controllers** *November 2017* A proposal for using reinforcement learning on the Cheetah robot to learn control functions for walking. I formulate the Q function as the solution of a differential equation and also derive the connection between Q learning, Lagrangian augmentation, and controllers based on energy functionals.
4. **Measurement-Free Calibration of Freehand Ultrasound Systems** *August 2017* An efficient, measurement-free, optimization-based method for estimating the transformation matrix between the ultrasound frame coordinate system and a position sensor coordinate system through scans of a single metal interface.
5. **Simple and Accurate Pose Estimation Using Unique Markers** *July 2017* An end-to-end technique for pose estimation of multiple unique markers in a scene, including marker design, detection of marker features, and 3D pose estimation from marker corners, which I used to perform pose estimation of an ultrasound probe from an overhead camera feed.
